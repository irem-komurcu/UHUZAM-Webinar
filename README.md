# Deep Learning in Remote Sensing
<p>Hi! This tutorial includes my research, presentations, slides, recommendations and resources for the remote sensing area. It will be <b>updated and renewed</b> over time. I suggest you to star and follow the developments in the repo. </p>

## Object Detection 
Object detection is a technology related to computer vision and image processing that allows us to detect, identify, classify and track objects in images and videos. Many objects can be detected with object detection techniques. Plane detection, bridge detection, vehicle detection, ship detection and more can do with the object detection. In the image below, there are some examples of remote sensing data. (Image Source: https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/11/3/339)
